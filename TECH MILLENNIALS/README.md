#### Team Name - TECH MILLENNIALS
#### Problem Statement -  Identifying Misleading Claims
Objective: Develop tools and models to identify influencers who make misleading claims about investment or trading in the securities market on digital platforms.

Challenge: The rise of digital platforms has led to an influx of misleading investment claims made by self-proclaimed influencers. These false claims can lead to financial losses for unsuspecting investors. This challenge seeks solutions in the form of models, tools, and products that analyze and evaluate the credibility of influencers on digital platforms. Leveraging technologies like Gen Ai and Machine Learning, these solutions aim to detect and flag misleading claims, safeguarding investors from potential risks.

## A Brief of the Prototype:

Our model considers various parameters to identify misleading contents.
1. Sentiment Analysis Insights: Our platform employs advanced sentiment analysis models to provide users with deep insights into the sentiment surrounding influencers content, comments, helping investors gauge market sentiment and make more informed decisions.
2. Historical Accuracy Assessment: We leverage LSTM networks to meticulously analyze past predictions and recommendations made by influencers and engagement metrics like likes, comments, and shares to determine authenticity offering users an accurate assessment of their historical performance.
3. Jargon and Sensationalism Detection: Our platform employs NLP techniques to identify the presence of intricate jargon and sensational language in influencers' content, helping users distinguish between authentic and potentially misleading claims.
4. Dynamic Credibility Scoring: We offer users a dynamic credibility scoring mechanism that combines multiple parameters to provide an overall assessment of an influencer's credibility, empowering investors to confidently navigate the digital investment landscape.
5. Expertise and Background Extraction: Using NER, our system extracts comprehensive details about influencers' professional backgrounds, any required disclosures, affiliations, and sponsorships enabling users to evaluate their credibility and expertise in the investment and trading domain.
